# Introduction

Welcome to Aucry. Aucry is an innovative new take on dollar / penny auctions for the Cryptocurrency era. Instead of bidding in fiat currencies for designer goods or luxury electronics against others within their country, Aucry enables people worldwide to compete against each other for growing pools of cryptocurrency, which can be instantly accessed by the winner.

An Aucry Auction is created with an initial ‘Auction Wallet Value’. Users then pay increasing amounts to bid on the prize, in turn increasing the value of the auction wallet. When the time limit on an auction is reached, the current high bidder wins the prize. Aucry - **au**ctions for **cry**pto.

### What makes Aucry unique?

1. **The time limit on an auction is variable.** \
   ****When an auction is created, an ‘earliest end time’ is set, along with, _optionally_, a ‘critical threshold’ and ‘seconds to extend’. If these two parameters are set, when the remaining seconds left in an auction is less than the ‘critical threshold’ and a new bid is placed, the auction is extended by the ‘seconds to extend’. This gamifies the concept, creates a sense of FOMO amongst all participants, creates drama and gives a viral nature to the auctions. \
   Our slogan - ‘Time, to make money’ – references this.
2. **Aucry is a platform.** \
   Anyone can create an Aucry auction for any amount of any compatible token. Initially, BSC tokens will be supported, with future support possible for additional chains. Aucry Auctions will become not only a viral sensation due to the size of prizes on offer over time, but also an important marketing tool for new crypto token launches.
3. **Profile System**\
   All users who connect wallets are able to choose a profile image (powered by Unsplash) and set a unique profile name. When involved in an auction as bidder or creator, this creates a more human element while maintaining the preferred anonymity of the blockchain. Verified profiles with extended details will be available for project teams.
4. **Everything happens on-chain.** \
   When an auction is created, the hub contract creates an auction contract, passing the initial value to the auction, and as bids are placed, these increase the value of the tokens owned by the auction contract. Once an auction is won, ownership of the smart contract is reassigned to the winning bidder, granting them access to withdraw its value to their wallet.
5. **Open Source**\
   ****We believe strongly in the power of open source, and will publish source code where legally possible. Our core website is built upon a licensed framework, but we will open source components we create ourselves or where we build components on open source libraries. Our contracts - both hub and auction - will be fully verified on BSCScan and also available on our GitHub repository.

&#x20;**We are Aucry**. A platform like no other for creating pay-to-bid crypto auctions.

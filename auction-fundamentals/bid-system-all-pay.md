# Bid System (All-Pay)

When a bid is placed, the user pays their bid price **in full at time of bidding**. The bid price paid is split three ways

* **Up to 90% from each bid placed is transferred to the Aucry Auction contract, thus increasing the value of the auction contract.**
* Auction Creators can specify a percentage fee when creating an auction. This is a variable percentage, publicised on the auction details page.
* A 10% platform fee is taken on each bid. This is used to fund future development, pay for community expansion, pay for use of premium blockchain resource providers, fund marketing and generate profit.&#x20;

**Example:** Our previous example auction was created with **initial value** of 100 USDT.&#x20;

**Bid 1** - 1 USDT - increases the value of the auction prize to 100.90.

**Bid 2** - 2 USDT - increases the value of the auction prize to 102.70.

**Bid 3** - 3 USDT -  increases the value of the auction prize to 105.40.

**Bid 4** - 4 USDT - increases the value of the auction prize to 109

**Bid 5** - 5 USDT-  increases the value of the auction prize to 113.50.

\
**Fast forwarding:**

After 10 bids, the auction prize would be worth **149.50**

After 100 bids, the auction prize would be worth **4290.40**

After 500 bids, the auction prize would be **111030.40**

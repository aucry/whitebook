# Auction Ending

### Won Auctions

At the end of the auction, the winning bidder can press a button to claim ownership of the **Aucry Auction** contract along with the tokens accumulated throughout the auction.&#x20;

A convenient button enables the winner to transfer the accumulated tokens directly to their wallet address, draining the auction contract of value. This button is visible to the winner bidder on the auction detail page, together with their 'My Aucry' user profile page.

### Unsold Auctions

The auction creator can optionally set a **Reserve Price** when creating an auction. If this bid price is not reached, the auction is deemed unsold, and the creator can request their initial auction value deposit be returned.

Upon requesting this action, the bids placed by each bidder are also refunded, less the platform fees and creator fees which are taken at the point bids are placed. This means if an auction is not won, bidders can receive up to 90% of their bids back.

Any user who placed a bid can also trigger this action on an unsold auction, enabling bidders to be confident that their funds are safe.
